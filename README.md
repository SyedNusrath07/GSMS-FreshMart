# Grocery Store Management System (GSMS)

This is my final year project, Grocery Store Management System (GSMS). I have developed this project using the following technologies:

- React
- TypeScript
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- React Router
- Context API for state management

The project is a digital grocery store web application that allows users to browse products, manage their cart and wishlist, and place orders.

Developed by Syed Nusrath Hussaine.
